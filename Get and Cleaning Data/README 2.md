Objectives
----------

### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

subject: each number represents each person
X: training set
y: activities
In step 1, we merge the above three data sets for training data set and testing data set separately. Then, we merge the merged training data set and testing data set into a whole.

### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Each variable has its own meaning. Here we only extract the variables labeled as mean or standard deviation.

### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

We change the activity names from numbers to their actual names.

### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

We replace the variable names by more appropriate descriptive names.

### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

We summarize the data based on activity and subject.
